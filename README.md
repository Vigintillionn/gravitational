# Gravitational
Gravitational is my first python game. It is inspired by a game in one of Barji's videos. This is also where the art is from.

## How to play
By clicking on the buttons in the UI or by click 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 you can select a planet. Placing those planets will apply gravitational force to the character. Try to get him home as fast as possible with as few deaths as possible, by navigating him through the levels. Avoid spikes and hitting planets as hitting them, will kill you!
